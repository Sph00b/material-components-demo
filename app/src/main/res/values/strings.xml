            <p>
                Text fields allow users to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

            </p>
            <p>
                Text fields come in two types:
                <ul>
                    <li>Filled text fields
                    <li>Outlined text fields
                </ul>
                Both types of text fields use a container to provide , making the fields discoverable in layouts.
                Both types of text fields provide the same functionality: a clear affordance for interaction. The type of text field you use can depend on style alone.

                <h3>Filled text field</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                Filled text fields have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields, making them stand out when surrounded by other content and components.

                <h3>Outlined text field</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                Outlined text fields have less visual emphasis than filled text fields. When they appear in places like forms, where many text fields are placed together, their reduced emphasis helps simplify the layout.

            <p>
                Icons in text fields are optional. Text field icons can describe valid input methods (such as a microphone icon), provide affordances to access additional functionality (such as clearing the content of a field), and can express an error.

        <h1>Usage</h1>
    </p>
    <p>Bottom navigation bars display three to five destinations at the bottom of a screen. Each destination is represented by an icon and an optional text label. When a bottom navigation icon is tapped, the user is taken to the top-level navigation destination associated with that icon.</p>]]>

            <p>
                <h3>When to use</h3>
            </p>
            <p>Bottom navigation should be used for:
        <ul>
          <li>  Top-level destinations that need to be accessible from anywhere in the app
          <li>  Three to five destinations
           <li> Mobile or tablet only
        </ul>
        Bottom navigation shouldn’t be used for:
        <ul>
          <li>  Single tasks, such as viewing a single email
          <li>  User preferences or settings
        </ul>

    <string name="bottom_navigation_span_behavior"><![CDATA[
    <p>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Bottom navigation behaves differently on Android and iOS. When you select a bottom navigation item (one that’s not currently selected), each platform displays different outcomes:
<ul>
 <li>   On Android: the app navigates to a destination’s top-level screen. Any prior user interactions and temporary screen states are reset, such as scroll position, tab selection, and in-line search.
  <li>  On iOS: the destination reflects the user’s prior interaction. If the user previously visited that section of the app, they return to the last screen viewed (with its prior state preserved, if possible). Otherwise, the app navigates to the top-level screen.
</ul>
Default platform navigation can be overridden when needed to improve the user experience. For example, an Android app that requires frequent switching between sections can preserve each section’s state. Or, an iOS app can return users to the top-level screen (or reset their scroll position) if it better suits the use case.</p>]]>

    <string name="bottom_navigation_span_state"><![CDATA[
    <p>
        <h1>States</h1>
    </p>
    <p>Bottom navigation destinations may be active, inactive, focused or pressed.

Bottom navigation uses opacity and text to show when a destination is active. States are used to show pressed, focused, and unselected states.

Inactive destination states are represented with reduced opacities; active states have full opacity.
